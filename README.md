implementing simple bigram model to generate realistic names by training the model on 32 thousand names of people.
and using negative log likelihood to determine the the lost function which came upto the maximum of 2.4817256927490234
the model doesn't perform as smoothly as one would expect. as the bigram model in itself is quite simple and thus not produce desirable results. 
however i will be attempting to implement newer and more advance models to get to more and more realistic names. 
tune for more updates
